## Overview

Each record in Opensaber registry is uniquely identified using the id of the record which is generated using the namespace for the registry and a UUID. Currently the read API retrieves a record from the database using this identifier. Opensaber would require a feature by which records can be searched and retrieved based on different properties of a record which are public. 

## Assumptions

* Encrypted fields would not be available for search.
* Private fields would not be available for search.
* The search result would contain only public fields and it will not contain private or encrypted fields.

## Use Cases

* Search all entities for any given readable public attribute.
* Search all entities for any given relation.

## FAQs

* Should we have different operators for search? For e.g. search all teachers who were born after 1950 (assuming DOB is public). - _Currently the basic search feature handles only equality operation for each filter. Other operations are not in current scope._
* The current design proposes to do a either/or approach for property name and value. Should we consider both as a search scope? - _The implementation takes property name and value as a combination for search._
* What should be the maximum search result count? - _Search feature returns all matching results as per the current implementation. Limiting the results are not in current scope._
* Can we provide an ability to choose the content of the search result (for e.g. include only ids, or include ids and a set of given fields)? - _As per the current implementation, the nested records would include only the ids, but the primary record will include all fields._

## Approaches

### 1. Search using Neo4j

Currently, when a record is added to the registry, it is stored in Neo4j.  Each record is represented in the form of a sub-graph in the DB. Complex or nested records would be represented as nodes connected to each other by edges in the graph. Simple literal properties or fields of a record are stored as properties of a node. Search will be based only on fields of the record, that are public. Private or encrypted fields will not be a part of the search feature. 

#### Property Based Search

Property based search is performed by providing a field/property and a corresponding value to search for. The result of the search operation will include records for which this property exists and the value matches the input pattern. Search will be implemented using Gremlin traversal in Tinkerpop. 

In this search pattern, we will filter vertices and edges in the graph based on the property and value provided in the search input. The edge between 2 nodes describe the relationship between the nodes and the edge is identified by the label assigned to it. The property name provided in the search criteria can be used to filter the edge by it's label in order to search for complex nodes. The search criteria can filter vertices in the graph based on the properties of the vertices and their corresponding values.

### Impact
* This is a new API and it will not impact any other systems - DevOps.

#### Design

Below is the interface for search feature implementation.

```
public interface SearchService {
  
	public Graph search(String property, String value);

}
```

#### Search API

```
POST - /search
```

### 2. Search using Elasticsearch

An alternate approach to this would be storing the records and implementing search using Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch improves the search performance as it extremely fast and scalable. Records will be stored here in the form of documents and categorised under indices. A document is basically in JSON format and denormalized, which helps in faster searches. Elasticsearch exposes API to search documents within an index and type. There are multiple client libraries which can be used to interact with Elasticsearch. One option would be to use [Java Rest Client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high.html){:target="_blank"}. In order to insert records into Elasticsearch, we can use the event handler for transactions in Neo4j. The afterCommit method in this interface can be implemented to send data to Elasticsearch which will ensure that only when a transaction is successfully committed,  the data is sent. 

### Impact
* Codebase - Creation of an entity.
* Deployment - Configuration of Elasticsearch with Registry and creating wrapper APIs to interact with Elasticsearch.
